This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

For my Code Louisville JavaScript/React Course, I used the WordPress Rest API to pull in blogposts (title, date, and copy) from my wife's blog about healthy living: https://www.findingrubies.com.

To view, simply clone project and NPM start.
