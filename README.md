This project utilizes the React framework and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

For my Code Louisville JavaScript/React Course, I used the WordPress Rest API (posts and media endpoints) to pull in blogposts (title, date, and copy) and an image gallery from my wife's blog about healthy living: https://www.findingrubies.com.

I used react-router for improved navigation and bookmarkable/shareable URLs.

I then used CSS to style this project, with the goal of making it responsive to any viewport.

To view, simply clone repo, NPM install, and NPM start.
